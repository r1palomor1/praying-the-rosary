# Holy Rosary App - Feature To-Do List

## 🛑 URGENT FIXES (Next Session)

### Church Icon Quick Play - Daily Readings
- [ ] **Complete localStorage bridge for Daily Readings church icon**
  - Hook (`useDailyReadingsPlayback`) saves completions to localStorage
  - Need: DailyReadingsScreen to load completions from localStorage on mount
  - Add: 7-day cleanup for old daily reading completion data
  - Pattern: Match Rosary handoff (hook writes, screen reads)

### Progressive Glow Outline (Card Progress Indicator) - IDEA ONLY
- [ ] **Visual progress indication on card glow outline**
  - Current: Card outline glows solid color when church icon playing
  - Idea: As each reading/prayer completes, portion of outline turns green
  - Example: Daily Readings has 4 sections → 25% green per completed section
  - When all complete: Full green outline
  - After completion blessing: Revert to normal color
  - Could apply to all three cards:
    - Daily Readings: Based on number of readings (First Reading, Psalm, Gospel, Reflection)
    - Rosary: Based on prayer sections (Intro, Decades 1-5, Closing)
    - Bible in Year: Based on chapters in today's reading
  - Implementation: CSS conic-gradient or SVG stroke-dasharray
  - Note: Figure out technical approach before implementing

### Bible in a Year - Progress & Completion Improvements
- [ ] **365-day completion celebration**
  - Show toast when user completes all 365 days
  - Offer "Start Again" button to reset with new start date
- [ ] **Add "Reset Bible Progress" button in Settings**
  - Separate from general "Clear Prayer Progress" 
  - Confirmation dialog: "Are you sure? This will clear all completed days and chapters."
- [ ] **Start date change warning**
  - When user changes Bible start date in Settings, show warning
  - Alert: "Changing the start date will reset your Bible progress. Continue?"
  - If yes: Clear `completedDays` and `completedChapters` arrays
  - Prevents conflict between old completions and new start date
- [ ] **No automatic cleanup for Bible in a Year**
  - Keep data forever (year-long progress tracking)
  - Only clear on manual reset or start date change

---

- [x] **Floating Scroll Buttons** ✅ FIXED (Feb 16, 2026)
  - **Issue:** Buttons were not appearing due to scroll listener on window instead of container.
  - **Fix:** Attached listener to `.readings-content` using `useRef`.
  - **Polish:** Added premium glassmorphism style with Gold/Amber accents.

- [x] **Bible Text Paragraph Formatting** ✅ FIXED (Feb 16, 2026)
  - **Issue:** Stale cache prevented updates; Spanish lacked paragraphs.
  - **Fix:** Implemented "Blueprint Strategy", added `max-age=0` to API, and forced frontend cache bust (`layout_v1`).
- [x] **Tablet/Fold Layout Optimization** ✅ FIXED (Feb 16, 2026)
  - **Issue:** 4th card cutoff on Fold 5 inner screen.
  - **Fix:** Tuned `PrayerSelectionScreen` for tablet breakpoint (reduced padding/gaps, sized icons to 60px).

## ⚠️ DEVELOPER NOTICE
- **RESPECT THE APP:** Care for the application's quality and the user's detailed requirements. Do not make assumptions. Verify every change visually or via rigorous data checks before committing. The goal is EXCELLENCE, not just "done".

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY PROTOCOL 🚨

**BEFORE switching to a new agent (when current model hits quota):**

```bash
# USER must manually run these commands in terminal:
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: [describe current state]"
git push
```

**Why?** Prevents data loss from rogue agent actions (like `git checkout .`)

**Lesson Learned (Dec 21, 2024):** Lost 3+ hours of refactor work because uncommitted changes were reverted by next agent. **NEVER let an agent handle final commits when switching models!**

**Rule:** Commit frequently during work, and **ALWAYS commit manually before ending a session.**

## ✅ Completed Features

### 🎨 Daily Readings: Unified "Bible in a Year" Layout Migration (Completed)
- [x] **Redesign Daily Readings UI to match Bible in a Year**
  - **Goal:** Transplant the exact layout, theme, and user experience we built for the "Bible in a Year" screen to the "Daily Readings" screen.
  - **Structure:** Use the seamless dark background (`#191b1f`), "Section Cards" (for Reading 1, Psalm, Gospel, etc.) with "Expandable content rows" (hidden text by default).
  - **Audio Controls:** Replicate the same "Play All" logic at the top, and specific "Play Section / Chapter" logic on the cards.
  - **State & Logic Integration:** *Keep all the existing background logic* for Daily Readings (fetching USCCB/Vatican sources, offline fallbacks, liturgical coloring) but feed it into the new view layer.
  - **Smart Tracking UI:** Implement the checkmarks (`✅`), "Completed" styles, and "Mark as Complete" flows so it feels like the exact same app experience.

### 🎨 Bible in a Year: Compact Card Redesign (Completed Feb 20, 2026)

## 🔄 In Progress / Needs Refinement

## ✅ Completed Features (Jan 23, 2026 Session)

### Litany Progressive Reveal & Scrolling
- [x] **Litany Progressive Fade-In** ✅ COMPLETED (Commit: 69bb370)
  - **Implemented:** Rows fade in one-at-a-time as audio plays
  - **Solution:** Track revealed rows in state array, trigger on audio segment start
  - **Scrolling:** Smooth centered scroll using `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' })`
  - **Resume Support:** Tracks last played row for seamless resume from pause
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/components/MysteryScreen.tsx` - Progressive reveal logic + scroll function
    - `src/components/ClassicMysteryView.tsx` - Render revealed rows with fade-in
    - `src/components/CinematicMysteryView.tsx` - Render revealed rows with fade-in
    - `src/components/SacredPrayersScreen.tsx` - Added missing `revealedRows` prop
  - **Result:** Cinematic reveal experience that guides user's attention during litany prayer

- [x] **Debug Panel UI Polish** ✅ COMPLETED (Commit: ef28096)
  - **Updated:** Changed debug panel button from text to Bug icon
  - **Repositioned:** Moved from bottom-right to top-right (below settings icon)
  - **Styling:** Matched opacity adjuster style (transparent background, drop-shadow)
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/components/DebugPanel.tsx` - Changed button to icon with aria-label
    - `src/components/DebugPanel.css` - Updated positioning and removed outline
  - **Result:** Cleaner UI with consistent icon-based controls

### API Resilience & Fallback System
- [x] **Romcal API Fallback System - Unified Approach** ✅ COMPLETED (Commit: 52251ec)
  - **Implemented:** Date-aware fallback when romcal API fails
  - **Solution:** Created `getFallbackLiturgicalData(date, language)` in liturgicalCalendar.ts
  - **Season Detection:**
    - Dec 1-24: "Advent" + Violet (#8B5CF6)
    - Dec 25-Jan 6: "Christmas" + White (#F3F4F6)
    - Lent (Ash Wed to Easter -1): "Lent" + Violet (#8B5CF6)
    - Easter (Easter to +49 days): "Easter" + White (#F3F4F6)
    - Default: "Ordinary Time" + Green (#10B981)
  - **Easter Calculation:** Meeus/Jones/Butcher algorithm
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/utils/liturgicalCalendar.ts` - Added fallback generator + Easter calc
    - `src/components/PrayerSelectionScreen.tsx` - Conditional render with fallback
    - `src/components/DailyReadingsScreen.tsx` - Simplified fetch with fallback
  - **Result:** App works offline with season-appropriate colors

- [x] **Cross-API Fallback for Feast Names** ✅ COMPLETED (Commit: c97e384)
  - **Implemented:** Multi-source fallback chain for liturgical titles
  - **Prayer Selection Enhancement:**
    - Romcal returns generic weekday → Fetches USCCB title
    - Reuses existing `/api/readings` endpoint
  - **Daily Readings Title Fallback:**
    - USCCB title → Vatican title (already fetched) → Generic weekday
    - No additional API calls needed
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/components/PrayerSelectionScreen.tsx` - Added USCCB fetch on fallback
    - `src/components/DailyReadingsScreen.tsx` - Uses Vatican title if USCCB missing
  - **Result:** Real feast names survive single API failure

- [x] **HTML Entity Cleanup for TTS** ✅ COMPLETED (Commit: 0c0c1a4)
  - **Issue:** Spanish TTS reading "nbsp" instead of space
  - **Root Cause:** Audio text only removed HTML tags, not entities
  - **Solution:** Added entity replacement: `&nbsp;`, `&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/components/DailyReadingsScreen.tsx` - Both handlePlayContent and handlePlayAll
  - **Result:** Clean audio playback without entity artifacts

- [x] **Liturgical Color Sorting Fix (Romcal v3 Upgrade)** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Issue:** Romcal v1.3 returned multiple events, picked first (often incorrect Green)
  - **Root Cause:** No rank/color prioritization in API
  - **Solution:** Upgraded to romcal v3 which handles priority internally
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `/api/liturgy.js` - Now uses romcal v3 with automatic priority handling
  - **Result:** Correct liturgical colors (Red/White feasts prioritized over Green)
  - **Verification:** Line 70 comment: "The first item is always the primary celebration (romcal v3 handles priority)"

## ✅ Completed Features (Jan 24, 2026 Session)

### UI Enhancements & Fixes
- [x] **Rosary Reminder Toggle** (Opt-In)
  - **Implemented:** New setting "Daily Rosary Reminder" in Settings > Display
  - **Behavior:** Defaults to OFF. When ON, Rosary card glows if incomplete, shows checkmark if complete
  - **Logic:** Persists to localStorage (`rosary_reminder_enabled`)
  - **Files Modified:** `SettingsModal.tsx`, `PrayerSelectionScreen.tsx`

- [x] **Timezone Synchronization Fix**
  - **Issue:** App showed "tomorrow's" feast day in the evening (UTC vs Local mismatch)
  - **Root Cause:** `fetchLiturgicalDay` used `date.toISOString()` which converts to UTC
  - **Solution:** Switched to local date formatting (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - **Files Modified:** `utils/liturgicalCalendar.ts`

- [x] **Prayer Selection Subtitles Restoration**
  - **Issue:** Subtitles had reverted to generic slogans during a previous refactor
  - **Action:** Restored original descriptive text ("Joyful, Sorrowful..." etc.)
  - **Files Modified:** `PrayerSelectionScreen.tsx`

### Documentation & Process Improvements
- [x] **Code Reuse Verification Protocol** - Added to .

  - Mandatory check for existing implementations before coding
  - Prevents duplicate logic and wasted resources
  
- [x] **Git Workflow Documentation** - Updated in .cursorrules
  - Clarified mandatory sequence: build → commit → build → push
  - Ensures version.json accuracy

- [x] Remove debug console logs from production code
- [x] Add error boundaries for highlighting feature
- [x] Update HIGHLIGHTING_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md with final state
- [x] Fix TypeScript 'any' type violations
- [x] Clean production build verification

## ⚠️ Litany Highlighting Decision

**Status:** DISABLED after extensive testing

**Attempts Made:**
- Option 2: TTS boundary events (browser incompatibility)
- Option 3: Conservative timing estimates
- Option 4: Sync checkpoints at transition points
- Option 5: Adaptive speeds with safety buffers

**Root Cause:** Web Speech API doesn't provide reliable timing across languages/voices
- English: ~90% accuracy achieved
- Spanish: Failed due to different TTS speeds
- Time-based estimation inherently unreliable

**Decision:** Excellence over compromise - no highlighting is better than inaccurate highlighting
- Litany text remains fully visible and readable
- Code preserved (unreachable) for future reference if better TTS APIs emerge

## 🐛 Daily Readings Issues (Jan 18-19, 2026)

### ✅ Resolved Issues
- [x] **Version Date Showing Wrong Date** ✅ FIXED (Jan 19, 2026)
  - **Root Cause:** `new Date("YYYY-MM-DD")` parsed as UTC, causing timezone shift to previous day in Western timezones
  - **Solution:** Updated `src/utils/version.ts` to parse date string directly instead of using Date object
  - **Fix:** String splitting (`"2026-01-19".split('-')`) avoids timezone conversion
  - **Commit:** 8c204c3 - "fix(frontend): Correct timezone calculation for commit date"
  - **Status:** Deployed and verified working

- [x] **Lectionary Label Not Centered** ✅ FIXED
  - Changed to space-between layout
  - Added .lectionary-text class with text-align: center
  - **Status:** Verified working on device

- [x] **Responsorial Psalm Highlighting** ✅ DECISION: NOT FEASIBLE
  - **Issue:** R/ and R. responses need <strong> tags from API to highlight correctly
  - **Root Cause:** USCCB API does not include <strong> tags in responsorial psalm text
  - **Attempted Solutions:**
    - Regex fallback: `^(R[.\/]\s*(?:R[.\/]\s*)?)(.*)` - too unreliable
    - Manual parsing: Would require maintaining psalm response patterns
  - **Decision:** Removed highlighting logic for responsorial responses
  - **Rationale:** Better to have no highlighting than incorrect highlighting (Excellence over compromise)
  - **Status:** Closed - will not implement unless API provides proper markup

### Active Issues
- [x] **Words of the Pope Card** ✅ COMPLETED (Jan 18-19, 2026)
  - Implemented Vatican News integration via serverless API
  - Created `/api/vatican-reflection.js` proxy to bypass CORS
  - Added source selector dropdown (USCCB vs Vatican)
  - Both sources now display "Words of the Popes" reflections
  - **Status:** Deployed and working

### Liturgical Integration
- [x] **Liturgical Calendar Integration** ✅ COMPLETED (Jan 19-20, 2026)
  - **Strategy:** Backend-only implementation (Zero-Config Client)
  - **Logic:** Used `romcal` library in Vercel Serverless Function (`api/liturgy.js`)
  - **Frontend:** Light card component fetches JSON from proxy
  - **Styling:**
    - Premium glass morphism
    - Dynamic header coloring (match liturgical color)
    - Responsive typesetting (Cinzel font)
  - **Status:** Deployed and working

## 📋 Planned Features

### User Feedback & UX Improvements

### Audio & Highlighting Enhancements
- [ ] Pause/Resume support for highlighting (track elapsed time)
- [ ] Fine-tune timing based on actual TTS performance

### Code Quality
- [x] Clean up debug logs
- [x] Add error boundaries for highlighting feature

## 🔬 Lightweight On-Device TTS Research (Priority)

### Problem Statement
Web Speech API works but has limitations:
- No precise timing control (litany highlighting issues)
- Voice quality varies by device/OS
- No control over pace/tone

Previous attempts with Sherpa/Piper failed due to integration issues, NOT download size.
Need to revisit with fresh debugging approach.

### Lightweight TTS Candidates to Research

**1. Piper TTS** ⭐ (Most Promising)
- **Size:** 10-30 MB per voice
- **Quality:** Good, natural-sounding
- **Timing:** Provides phoneme-level timing data
- **WebAssembly:** Yes (runs in browser)
- **Languages:** English + Spanish supported
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/rhasspy/piper
- **Status:** Actively maintained
- **Action:** Debug previous integration failure, try fresh implementation

**2. Sherpa-ONNX** (Previously Attempted)
- **Size:** 50-200 MB per model
- **Quality:** Excellent
- **Timing:** Word-level timestamps available
- **WebAssembly:** Yes
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx
- **Status:** We had integration issues - models downloaded but app never used them
- **Action:** Debug why fallback to Web Speech always occurred

**3. eSpeak-NG**
- **Size:** <5 MB (tiny!)
- **Quality:** Robotic (1990s sound)
- **Timing:** Excellent control
- **WebAssembly:** Available
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng
- **Status:** Maintained but quality may be too low
- **Action:** Test quality vs. Web Speech API

**4. Coqui TTS**
- **Size:** 50-100 MB
- **Quality:** Excellent
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS
- **Status:** ⚠️ Project archived (no longer maintained)
- **Action:** Skip unless no other options

**5. New/Emerging Options**
- [ ] Research latest WebAssembly TTS projects on GitHub
- [ ] Check for new lightweight neural TTS models (2024)
- [ ] Look for ONNX-based TTS with small model sizes
- [ ] Investigate WebGPU-accelerated TTS options

### Implementation Requirements

**Must Have:**
- ✅ Runs entirely on-device (browser/WebAssembly)
- ✅ Works offline after initial download
- ✅ Provides timing data (word or phoneme level)
- ✅ Supports English + Spanish
- ✅ <50 MB total download size
- ✅ Free/open source

**Nice to Have:**
- Voice customization (pace, pitch, tone)
- Multiple voice options per language
- Low battery/CPU usage on mobile
- Streaming synthesis (start playing before full generation)

### Debugging Previous Failures

**Sherpa/Piper Integration Issues to Investigate:**
1. Model loading - Did models actually initialize?
2. API calls - Were Sherpa functions being called correctly?
3. Fallback logic - Why did it always default to Web Speech?
4. Error handling - Were errors silently caught?
5. Browser compatibility - Did it work in some browsers but not others?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Review old Sherpa integration code (if still exists)
- [ ] Check browser console for model loading errors
- [ ] Test model initialization in isolation
- [ ] Verify WebAssembly support in target browsers
- [ ] Create minimal reproduction case

### Next Steps
1. **Research Phase** (1-2 hours)
   - Survey latest lightweight TTS options on GitHub
   - Check for 2024 releases/updates
   - Read integration docs for top 3 candidates

2. **Proof of Concept** (2-3 hours)
   - Implement Piper TTS in isolated test page
   - Verify model loading and audio generation
   - Test timing data accuracy
   - Measure performance on mobile

3. **Integration** (3-4 hours)
   - Wire into existing `ttsManager.ts`
   - Add settings toggle: "Enhanced Voices (requires download)"
   - Implement graceful fallback to Web Speech
   - Test across devices

4. **Polish** (1-2 hours)
   - Add download progress indicator
   - Cache models in IndexedDB
   - Optimize for mobile performance

**Target Outcome:** Perfect litany highlighting with on-device TTS
