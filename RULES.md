# 👑 PROJECT RULES - READ FIRST

## 1. Explicit Permission for Builds & Deploys
*   **NEVER** run `npm run build` or `git push` without asking the user for permission first.
*   **NEVER** assume a workflow allows auto-deployment unless explicitly told for that specific turn.
*   Always present the plan and wait for "Go ahead" or "Yes".

## 2. No Jumping the Gun
*   Do not perform actions based on assumptions.
*   Answer questions first.
*   Propose solution -> Get Approval -> Implement.
*   Do not start implementation while answering a question.

## 3. Atomic Updates (Standard)
*   Check build status *before* pushing if permission is granted.
